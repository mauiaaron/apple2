# ndk-build module definition for the Google Breakpad client library
#
# To use this file, do the following:
#
#   1/ Include this file from your own Android.mk, either directly
#      or with through the NDK's import-module function.
#
#   2/ Use the client static library in your project with:
#
#      LOCAL_STATIC_LIBRARIES += breakpad_client
#
#   3/ In your source code, include "src/client/linux/exception_handler.h"
#      and use the Linux instructions to use it.
#
# This module works with either the STLport or GNU libstdc++, but you need
# to select one in your Application.mk
#

# The top Google Breakpad directory.
# We assume this Android.mk to be under 'android/google_breakpad'
