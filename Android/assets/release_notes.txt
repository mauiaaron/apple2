Apple2ix (a2ix) 2.1.0-RC1 for Android

GENERAL:

- Provide full 64bit native builds for ARMv8 and x64 platforms (this is a forced change due to a new hard G00G requirement for publishing)
- Migrated menu system to newer-ish Dark Holo theme (again, because G00G is forcing my hand)

TOUCH KEYBOARD:

- New preference for dual-thumb touch keyboard handling
- More alternate keyboard presets for old-school RPGs
- Tapping Open/Closed-Apple keys now generate joystick button events

TOUCH JOYSTICKS:

- Keypad Joystick: Improved emulation fidelity for the keyboard auto-repeat circuitry, tied to the emulated video refresh.
- Keypad Joystick: Full left and right side rosette key configurations
- Keypad Joystick: More presets for popular games (L0de Runner, R0b0tr0n 2084, ...)
- Joystick: Can now configure a button to fire on left/right swipe (instead of just touch down, swipe up/down)
- Keypad/Joystick: Button/key switch threshold now configurable down to zero minimum
- Moved some preferences around a bit for clarity
